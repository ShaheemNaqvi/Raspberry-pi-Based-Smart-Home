Raspberry-pi-Based-Smart-Home

Our goals were to automate home using internet based application to get fast response, to access the home from all over the world and to 
give surveillance to the home. We also created different modes for house and used some basic sensors to make it smart. This system can be 
modified to control anything in your home as per user demands.

Statement of Problem:

The statement of our problem is to design such a system which can be use in any kind of automation and also can use in security 
surveillance. Plus the system should be capable of any further new addition or changeings to it and new upgrades/. Designing a 
multipurpose system which can be use in automation bus also for security surveillance and can interact with different sensors.  	

Purpose of the project:

The purpose of this  project  is to  implement  a low  cost,  reliable  and scalable home automation system that can be used to remotely 
switch on or off any household appliance, Raspberry pi based Smart  Home should  be  able  to control  the  home appliances wirelessly 
with effectively and efficiently.

Controlling Home Appliances via web and application:

To  develop  an  application  that  includes  the  features  of  controlling all home appliances and to control the security system of 
home.

Real Time Video Streaming from IP camera:

To receive the quality video from the camera to the android application.

Secure Connection Channels between Application and Raspberry pi :

Use  of  secure  protocols  over  Wi-Fi  so  that  other  devices  cannot  control  the appliances. Options for secure connection is 
SSL over TCP, SSH

Controlled by any device capable of Wi-Fi (Android, iOS, PC) :

To  make  the  home  appliances  flexible  in  control,  any  device  capable  of  Wi-Fi connectivity will able to control the home 
appliances from remote location.

Extensible platform for future enhancement:

The application is to be highly extensible, with possibility of adding features in the future as needed.
