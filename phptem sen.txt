Terminal window commands to configure temperature sensor:-


1: To add support for OneWire, we first need to open up the boot config file, and this can be 
done by running the following command.
•	sudo nano /boot/config.text

2: At the bottom of this file enter the following.
•	dtoverlay=w1-gpio   (write this line at the end of page after entering the above command).

3:Once done save & exit by pressing ctrl x and then y. Now reboot the Pi by running the following command.
•	sudo reboot

4: Once the Raspberry Pi has booted back up, we need to run modprobe so we can load the correct modules.
•	sudo modprobe w1-gpio
•	sudo modprobe w1-therm

5: Now change into the devices directory and use ls to see the folders and files in the directory.
•	cd /sys/bus/w1/devices
•	ls

6: Now run the following command, change the numbering after cd to what has appeared in your directory 
by using the ls command. (If you have multiple sensors there will be more than one directory)
•	cd (28-000007602ffa)

7: Now run the following command.
•	cat w1_slave


<?php
//File to read
$file = '/sys/bus/w1/devices/28-00299b120204/';

//Read the file line by line
$lines = file($file);

//Get the temp from second line 
$temp = explode('=', $lines[1]);

//Setup some nice formatting (i.e. 21,3)
$temp = number_format($temp[1] / 1000, 1, ',', '');

//And echo that temp
echo $temp . " °C";
?>
